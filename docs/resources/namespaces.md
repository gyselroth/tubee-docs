# Namespaces

tubee has most things sorted in namespaces. Meaning a resource is attached on a namespace to avoid name conflicts and also make
it easy to deploy RBAC rules.

## Create a new namespace

```yaml 
kind: Namespace
name: playground
```

```sh
tubectl create -f spec.yaml
```

Check the just created resource:

```sh
tubectl get ns foobar -o yaml
```

The namespace `foobar` is now ready.
>**Note** Namespace is the simplest resource type of all, it only requires a name.
